# BadAppleButItsTownscaper

Townscraper is really good game, anyway, let's play bad apple on it

Here is the demo on youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZD9uIw2yj4

So i use townscaper, a game were you put voxels where you to, and the game deal with it to make it pretty.

Here I wanted to make a screen with differents color blocks

Basically : my program loads an image, convert it in the import text format of townscaper, takes control over my mouse, click on import, wait till import is done, move the cam (de-zoom, and re-center), and finally takes a screenshot and save it
Repeat that 1739 times and convert all the image into a video, and bam you've done it

I used https://github.com/alvaro-cuesta/townsclipper to make import format (that we can use by clicking import from clipboard)
